# Exploring single cell genomics datasets

Here, I play around with several single cell RNA sequencing datasets with the goal of getting comfortable with preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference etc, and learning about the computational methods underlying these analyses.

Note that all of this is based on the excellent workshop on single cell analysis by the Krishnaswamy lab (https://www.krishnaswamylab.org/workshop).
